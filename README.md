After years of just dumping my photos off of my phone onto my computer.
I eventually wanted to organize all of them by year and month.
So being to geek I am. I decided to write something to do the work for me.

This repo is mainly a safe place to keep the code so I dont lose it but feel free to use it if you like.
That being said. This has no warranty or even any decent error control beside a few checks here and there.

Thanks,
Liam
